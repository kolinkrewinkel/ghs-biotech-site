    <section id="overview">
      <p>
        Granada High School's biotechnology program provides an immersive
        experience, allowing participating students to learn basic principles of
        lab science. Over the course of the pathway, students will be guided
        through increasingly complex labs to increase self-sufficiency and
        workplace readiness.
      </p>

      <p>
        Students can expect to put in a solid amount of effort in class to
        complete labs, but homework will be minimal and always pertinent to
        actual labwork and its analysis.

          Biotechnology 1A is a skills-based course teaching &ldquo;SLOP,&rdquo;
          the Standard Lab Operating Procedures that every lab worker must
          master. SLOP includes safety, documentation, experimental design, data
          analysis and reporting, solution preparation, sterile technique, cell
          culture, DNA isolation and analysis, and protein isolation and
          analysis.

          Biotechnology 1B is the application of the basic skills mastered in
          the 1A portion. It's a required follow-up and focuses on applying the
          protein and DNA techniques to analyze and modify DNA sequences.

          Biotechnology 2A delves into more complicated applications. This
          course is the second in the series that will prepare students for a
          career as a lab technician or will prepare them for further study at a
          4-year college. Students will learn more advanced techniques in
          biotechnology and will be working more independently. Participants
          will be scientifically published through the Rutgers University DNA
          sequencing during this program.

          This course is dedicated towards researching and developing a project
          to be submitted to the Livermore Science Odyssey and the Alameda
          County Science &amp; Engineering Fair. Students will work
          independently with the guidance of Mrs. Lopez individually or in
          groups in order to build professional academic projects for judging.
